# eMinuto

eMinuto is a free and open-source desktop software for a self-created, decentralized, trust-based digital means of payment, based on the idea of Minuto Cash. For more information about Minuto, visit [minuto.wiki](https://minuto.org/).

eMinuto is Based on Minuto: What is Minuto?

Minuto is a service-based currency (vouchers backed by labor time), where 60 Minuto equals a voucher for goods and services worth 60 minutes of quality work. Creators issue vouchers additionally secured by a male and female guarantor.

### Key Features of Minuto

- Decentralized, usable like cash, stable value, trust and meaning-based.
- Can be created independently (no need for fiat money, electricity, etc.).
- Unobtrusive, introducing a new money paradigm (human value-based).
- Ideal medium of exchange (no incentives for speculation).
- Less hype due to stable value (no price surges attracting speculators).

## Motivation â€“ Why eMinuto?

Creating your own currency independent of institutions is appealing, and a digital extension is a natural progression. eMinuto caters to the digital age, providing an alternative for those who avoid cash. Businesses and freelancers typically make transactions via bank transfers rather than cash. Trust-based networks can now extend over greater distances through the internet, where traditional Minuto isn't applicable. Unlike cryptocurrencies often used for speculation, eMinuto is designed solely as a medium of exchange, ensuring value creation.

## Concept

eMinuto operates using text files that contain transaction lists (a miniblockchain). Instead of anonymous addresses, known user IDs are used. These text files are digitally signed by the creator and guarantors using their user IDs. eMinuto files are sent to users, with digital signatures in the transaction list confirming ownership. A global blockchain is unnecessary (no servers), and fraud detection (e.g., double spending) relies on social control and the high probability of detection and post-factum proof. Being excluded from the trusted network is a significant social penalty.

## Future Development

This prototype is intended to demonstrate that the concept works and how it can be utilized. However, a desktop application is not practical for many users. Therefore, the goal is to implement eMinuto for other platforms, especially mobile devices. If you have expertise in such development or can support in other ways, please reach out to us.
